## üëã About Me

At **Ford**, I gained hands-on experience improving **EV underbody systems**, where I focused on resolving critical voltage issues and streamlining documentation for better efficiency. My background extends beyond corporate settings; I have contributed to the **construction of an airplane**, mentored students as a teaching assistant, and led multiple hands-on engineering projects from conception to completion.

My goal is to leverage my skills in both hardware and software to build innovative and impactful solutions.
