## 🚀 About Me

I'm a hands-on ECE student at CMU passionate about building—from aircraft and audio hardware to autonomous robots. I enjoy tackling tough problems at the intersection of embedded systems, hardware design, and real-world applications.

- 🔬 **Interned at Ford**, solving power delivery issues and improving engineering documentation for EV platforms
- 🛠️ **Built a high-fidelity headphone amplifier**, redesigning the Objective2 for better audio quality and lower cost
- 🧠 **Taught and mentored students** in analog and RF circuit design as an ECE teaching assistant
- ✈️ **Helped construct a fully functional aircraft**, leading systems integration and airframe assembly
